  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Effective Date: July 26, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This application (<strong>Manuvector</strong>) collects only the
     information necessary to provide its functionality.</p>

  <h2>What data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your email address (for authentication and account identification).</li>
    <li>Access tokens for Google Drive and Notion (only with your explicit consent during connection).</li>
    <li>Files or pages that you explicitly select from your Google Drive or Notion account.
        These are processed to extract plain text and create AI embeddings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Selected files are processed temporarily and converted to text for AI-based document search and responses.</li>
    <li>Only embeddings (mathematical summaries of text) are stored in our database, not the original documents.</li>
    <li>Tokens are stored securely to let you reuse your connections without logging in each time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What we do not do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not share your data or files with any third parties.</li>
    <li>We do not access any Google Drive or Notion content you havenâ€™t explicitly selected.</li>
    <li>We do not use your files to train AI models.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can revoke access at any time via your Google Account and Notion account settings.</li>
    <li>If you delete your account, stored embeddings and tokens are removed.</li>
  </ul>
