  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: {{ date|default:"2025-07-26" }}</em></p>

  <p>Welcome to [Your App Name]! By using our service, you agree to the following terms. 
     If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

  <h2>1. What this app does</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Connect your own Google Drive and Notion accounts.</li>
    <li>Choose specific files or pages to include as context for AI-powered chat.</li>
    <li>Chat with an AI that uses the content of those files to help answer your questions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your content belongs to you.</strong> Files from Drive or Notion are processed temporarily
        to extract plain text and create embeddings (mathematical summaries). These embeddings are stored
        in our database so the AI can retrieve context later.</li>
    <li><strong>We do not share your files.</strong> The content and embeddings are private to your account and
        are not shared with other users.</li>
    <li><strong>Access tokens</strong> (for Drive and Notion) are securely stored so that you can reuse the
        connection without logging in each time. These tokens can be revoked at any time from your
        Google or Notion account settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How the AI works</h2>
  <p>The AI generates responses based on the content of your files and general knowledge.</p>
  <p><strong>No guarantees:</strong> Responses may be inaccurate or incomplete. You are responsible
     for verifying any important information.</p>

  <h2>4. Limitations and responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You agree not to upload or connect files that violate the law, contain harmful content,
        or that you are not authorized to use.</li>
    <li>We are not responsible for any loss, damage, or consequences caused by using the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
  <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide the service (account credentials, file embeddings, and logs).
     For details on data handling, see our <a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>6. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that abuse the service or violate these terms.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes</h2>
  <p>These terms may be updated from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the updated version here.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about these terms, contact: [your email/contact page]</p>
